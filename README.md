## Single Unit Delphi Engine

The aim of this project is to create a simple, single unit engine with no 3rd party dependencies.

The project goals are (subject to change):

* No 3rd party dependencies.
* No Delphi RTL dependencies. Only units from "Winapi".
* Simple to use.

I will go into more details once the engine does something useful
